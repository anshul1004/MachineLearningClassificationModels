# ParameterTuningofClassificationModels

We learned that parameter tuning is one of the most important parts in a machine learning project.
Rather than having to manually try every combination of parameters, scikit-learn provides tools
that can help automate this process. In this project, GridSearchCV (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) was used for automatic
parameter tuning for some of the machine learning classication algorithms.
